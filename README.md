Place an inspire button in your sidebar


== Description ==

A WordPress widget that accepts a set of image preferences and a 500px api key.
Will show up as a title and a button in your sidebar.
When someone clicks the button it will search 500px for an image matching your preferences and
display a result in a lightbox style popup.
Each click will likely have a different result, so it should help give you some ideas.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `natural-inspiration` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (or through the install plugin screen)
